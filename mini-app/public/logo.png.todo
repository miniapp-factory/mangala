A sleek, modern logo for the Turkish Mangala Mini App. The design features a stylized Mangala board with 12 pits and 2 stores arranged exactly like the traditional layout: Six pits on the left row, six pits on the right row, with two larger stores at the ends. The board is simplified into a minimal circular symbol. Inside the circle, each pit is represented by small clean dots or capsules, arranged in a perfectly symmetrical Mangala pattern. The two stores appear as slightly larger golden capsules on both ends. Soft glowing highlights give a sense of depth. The background is a deep navy blue with subtle gradients. A thin red crescent-and-star inspired arc curves around the top of the circle, referencing Turkish heritage without looking like a full flag. Overall style: minimalistic, modern, elegant, balanced, icon-ready, mobile-friendly, instantly recognizable as Turkish Mangala.
